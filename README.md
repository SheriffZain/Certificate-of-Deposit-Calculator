The certificate of deposit calculator allows the user to  
involves two possible outcomes. If the logical expression is True, a set of one or more statements is executed; if it is False, a different set of one or more statements is executed. To choose between two outcomes, Python provides the else keyword. The syntax and pattern of these statements is as follows:

For Example

To further illustrate the use of if and else, assume we want to write a program to calculate the ending value of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) investment. The bank offering the one-year CD will pay 3% interest for an investment up to $1,000. For investments of $1,000 or more, the bank will pay 3.25% interest. Program 3-6 computes the ending balance of an investment, where the interest rate depends on the amount of the investment.
