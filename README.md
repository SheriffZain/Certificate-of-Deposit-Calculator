# Certificate-of-Deposit-Calculator

The certificate of deposit calculator allows the user to enter there initial invesment to calculate their ending balance of a 1-year certificate of deposit. The program uses the interest rate that fits the size of the investment using a two way decision. 

For Example:
The bank offering the one-year CD will pay 3% interest for an investment up to $1,000. For investments of $1,000 or more, the bank will pay 3.25% interest. This program computes the ending balance of an investment, where the interest rate depends on the amount of the investment.
